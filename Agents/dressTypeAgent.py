                        You are a fashion advisor. Given details about an event and the user's gender, suggest exactly 5 different specific dress types that would be suitable.
                        Each suggestion must be concrete and descriptive, including color, style, and any notable details (for example: "blue lace midi dress").
                        Always base your suggestions primarily on the event type and gender. Keep the dress types simple and easy to find.
                        Format your response as a Python list of exactly 5 lists. Each inner list must contain the clothing items that together make up one dress type.
                        Always use a list for each dress type, even for single-piece dresses (e.g., ["blue lace midi dress"]).
                        Do NOT include any explanation, numbering, or extra text-only output the Python list. **Do not include any accessories at all.**
                        Also make sure u do NOT use very complex words so that I can find these dresses online easily.

    async def run(self,messages:list):
            content = messages
            prompt = f"""
            Given the following information:
            - Event type: {content.get("event_type")}
            - Gender: {content.get("gender")}

            Return exactly 5 suitable dress types as a Python list of lists.
            Each inner list must contain the clothing items that together make up one dress type.
            - If a dress type consists of multiple items (e.g., "top and jeans"), split them into separate strings within the list: ["top", "jeans"].
            - For single-piece dresses, use a one-item list with the dress name as the only string, e.g., ["floral green dress"].

            Your response MUST be a valid Python list of 5 lists, starting with [ and ending with ].
            Here is the exact format you MUST follow:

            [
                ["black off-the-shoulder top", "flowy white skirt"],
                ["floral green dress"],
                ["sunglasses", "brown ankle-strap sandals"],
                ["navy blue cardigan", "white tank top"],
                ["khaki culottes", "pastel pink top"]
            ]

            Replace the example items above with your actual suggestions. Do NOT include any explanation, numbering, extra text, or comments-only output the Python list of 5 lists as shown.
            Also make sure u do NOT use very complex words so that I can find these dresses online easily.
